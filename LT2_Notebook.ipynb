    "The data set has a total of 24 columns with most of the data being numeric save for the dots(...), geolocations, periods and column names. The data is generally structured neatly and orderly save for a few issues that can be cleaned and transformed. Every aspect is grouped together (total number,floor,area and type before becoming residential etc etc.) making the data generally easy to perform an analysis on. Minor issues with the data that can be cleaned would be the boxes(of data) containing \"..\", which can be changed into 0 (such as the data found in Alterations/Repairs/Renovations Floor area), some columns are also found empty which can be replaced with 0. Geographic locations also always start with 2 dots (..) so these 2 dots can be removed for cleanliness. Additionally some column names have unnecessary dots (...) in the middle of the names such as street furnitures...number, street furnitures...floor area and street furnitures...value. There are some rows with missing values such as the missing data values for Negros island region for the years 2006-2014 and 2017. Only 2015-2016 has respective annual and quarterly values for negros island region. ARMM is also found to have no values in the year 2006 for Quarter 4, as well as the lack of values found in demolitions floor area and street furnitures floor area. \n",
